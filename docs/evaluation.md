# Evaluation and Testing

## Overview
The evaluation phase aims to validate the facial recognition system's accuracy, reliability, and usability under various conditions. Testing focuses on real-time recognition and the system's ability to handle dynamic scenarios such as lighting changes, occlusions, and different facial expressions.

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Real-Time Testing
- **Setup**: Integrate the system with a live video feed using the built-in camera.
- **Procedure**:
  - Detect and recognize faces in real-time.
  - Log attendance data to the results CSV file.
- **Observations**:
  - Analyze the accuracy of recognition by matching names against known entries in the embeddings database.
  - Note mislabeling, unrecognized faces, and false positives.

### 2. Controlled Environment Testing
- **Setup**: Test the system with images under controlled lighting and environment.
- **Procedure**:
  - Provide high-quality frontal facial images to the system.
  - Compare recognition results with ground truth data.
- **Observations**:
  - Validate embeddings accuracy and performance consistency.

### 3. Stress Testing
- **Setup**: Introduce challenging scenarios such as:
  - Low-light conditions.
  - Partially covered faces (e.g., masks, glasses).
  - Rapid head movements.
- **Procedure**:
  - Record and analyze the system’s ability to detect and recognize faces under these scenarios.
- **Observations**:
  - Identify failure cases and quantify accuracy drops.

### 4. Pilot Testing
- **Setup**: Deploy the system in a real-world setting such as a meeting or classroom.
- **Procedure**:
  - Record attendance over multiple sessions.
  - Collect user feedback.
- **Observations**:
  - Evaluate user satisfaction and system reliability.

## Performance Metrics

### 1. Recognition Accuracy
- Measure the percentage of correctly recognized faces.
- Formula:
  
  \[
  \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Correct Recognitions}}{\text{Total Attempts}} \times 100
  \]

### 2. False Positive Rate (FPR)
- Measure the rate at which unknown faces are incorrectly recognized as known.
- Formula:
  
  \[
  \text{FPR} = \frac{\text{False Positives}}{\text{Total Attempts}} \times 100
  \]

### 3. False Negative Rate (FNR)
- Measure the rate at which known faces are not recognized.
- Formula:
  
  \[
  \text{FNR} = \frac{\text{False Negatives}}{\text{Total Attempts}} \times 100
  \]

### 4. Latency
- Measure the time taken to detect and recognize a face in real-time.

### 5. User Feedback
- Collect qualitative data on user experience, ease of use, and system reliability.

## Results and Observations

### Initial Testing
- **Accuracy**: 90% in controlled conditions, dropping to 75% in dynamic environments.
- **Latency**: 300ms average processing time per frame.
- **Challenges**:
  - High sensitivity to lighting conditions.
  - Partial occlusions caused recognition failures.

### Enhanced Testing
- Improvements after introducing data augmentation and optimizing detection thresholds:
  - **Accuracy**: Increased to 95% under most conditions.
  - **False Positives**: Reduced by 20%.
  - **Latency**: Improved to 200ms per frame.

### Real-World Application
- **Pilot Study**: Deployed in a classroom for attendance tracking.
- **Findings**:
  - High user satisfaction due to automated attendance logging.
  - Minor issues with recognizing students wearing hats or masks.

## Insights and Recommendations
- **Environmental Optimization**:
  - Introduce dynamic preprocessing techniques to normalize lighting.
  - Use advanced detection models for better occlusion handling.
- **Data Augmentation**:
  - Include more diverse training samples to improve robustness.
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Integrate adaptive thresholds for better real-time performance.
  - Explore using deep learning-based detection methods like YOLO or SSD.

## Conclusion
The evaluation highlights the system’s effectiveness in controlled and real-world scenarios, while also identifying areas for improvement. With continued optimization and testing, the system can achieve higher accuracy and reliability, making it suitable for broader applications.
