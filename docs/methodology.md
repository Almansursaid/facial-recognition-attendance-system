# Methodology

## Overview
This section outlines the tools, techniques, and processes used to design, implement, and test the facial recognition system. The methodology emphasizes efficient system design, robust data processing, and ethical implementation.

## Tools and Technologies

### Hardware
- **Development Environment**: MacBook Air (2019) with 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD.
- **Camera**: Built-in webcam for live video capture.

### Software
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.9.
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:
  - OpenCV: For face detection and image preprocessing.
  - TensorFlow/Keras: For deep learning and embedding generation.
  - NumPy: For numerical computations.
  - PIL: For image manipulation.

### Development Environment
- Jupyter Notebook: Used for iterative testing and debugging.
- Python Virtual Environment: To manage dependencies.

## Data Preparation

### Dataset Collection
- Images sourced from colleagues and public datasets.
- Includes diverse real-world scenarios to improve generalization.

### Preprocessing Pipeline
1. **Face Detection**:
   - Use Haar cascade classifiers to identify faces in images.
   - Skip images without detectable faces.

2. **Normalization**:
   - Convert images to RGB format.
   - Resize to 160x160 pixels (FaceNet requirement).

3. **Embedding Generation**:
   - Generate embeddings using the FaceNet model.
   - Save embeddings in a serialized database (e.g., `data.pkl`).

## System Implementation

### Architecture
1. **Face Detection**:
   - Detect faces using Haar cascades.
   - Extract and preprocess detected face regions.

2. **Recognition**:
   - Generate embeddings for detected faces.
   - Compare embeddings with the database to recognize individuals.

3. **Attendance Logging**:
   - Log recognized faces to a CSV file with timestamps.

### Real-Time Operation
- Integrate the system with live video feed.
- Display recognized faces with annotations on the video stream.

## Testing and Evaluation

### Controlled Testing
- Test with high-quality images under uniform conditions.
- Validate recognition accuracy against known results.

### Stress Testing
- Evaluate system performance under challenging scenarios:
  - Low-light environments.
  - Partial occlusions (e.g., masks, glasses).

### Pilot Deployment
- Deploy in a real-world setting (e.g., classroom).
- Collect user feedback and assess usability.

## Conclusion
The methodology ensures a systematic approach to designing and evaluating the facial recognition system. Emphasis on robust preprocessing, efficient implementation, and comprehensive testing contributes to the systemâ€™s reliability and adaptability.
